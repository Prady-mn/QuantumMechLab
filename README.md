# Overview
The project includes a variety topic questions for different weeks. You may run any file on Jupyter Notebook. ``Restart Kernel and Run All`` command will begin the interactives and show any associated results.

# Topic Wise Description
## Solar Spectra
Study of spectral intentisty through observations of the sun and comparing it with Planck's radiation law. The observation data has been taken from [https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/appendices/standard-solar-spectra](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/appendices/standard-solar-spectra). Download the datafile, [AM0AM1_5.xls](/SolarSpectra/AM0AM1_5.xls) to see the comparison. This has been plotted and compared with Planck's black body radiation curve at suitable temperature. 
The interactive visualises the black body curve at different temperatures. 
- To RUN the interactive, download and open [solarSpectra.ipynb](./SolarSpectra/solarSpectra.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
